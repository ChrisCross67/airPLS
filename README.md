# 1. Intorduction #

*adaptive iteratively reweighted Penalized Least Squares (airPLS) algorithm doesnâ€™t require any user intervention and prior information, such as detected peaks. It iteratively changes weights of sum squares errors (SSE) between the fitted baseline and original signals, and the weights of SSE are obtained adaptively using between previously fitted baseline and original signals. This baseline estimator is fast and flexible in fitting baseline.*


# 2. Installation #

## 2.1 MATLAB version ##

- Install MATLAB 6.5 or higher in you computer.
- download, unzip and enjoy it from this [url](https://github.com/zmzhang/airPLS/releases/download/2.0/airPLS.2.0.matlab.rar).

## 2.2 R version ##

By taking the advantage of sparse matrix in R package "Matrix", we implemented the sparse version of whittaker smoother and airPLS alogrithm. Now the speed of airPLS 2.0 is faster than airPLS 1.0 by 100 times or more.

- Firstly, you must download and install R 2.12.2 from the urls as follows:

	for linux: http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.2.tar.gz
	
	for windows: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/2.12.2/R-2.12.2-win.exe

- Then, download the airPLS package from this project download pages.

	for linux: https://github.com/zmzhang/airPLS/releases/download/2.0/airPLS_2.0.0.tar.gz
	
	for windows: https://github.com/zmzhang/airPLS/releases/download/2.0/airPLS_2.0.0.zip

## 2.3 Python version ##

Python version of airPLS using the scipy framework by Renato Lombardo of University of Palermo.



- Install Python
	Python 2.7 is recommended
	https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi


- Install Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib with following commands 

	```shell
	pip install numpy
	pip install scipy
	pip install matplotlib
	```
- clone this project and running [airPLS.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmzhang/airPLS/master/airPLS.py)

## 2.4 C++ version ##

We have already noticed the parameter optimizing problem in R and Matlab version of airPLS. So we have rewritten this airPLS algorithm in C++ and MFC (Visual Studio 2010) to provide a better user interface for baseline-correction. One can tune the lambda parameter by dragging the slider easily.

It can be downloaded from this [url](https://github.com/zmzhang/airPLS/releases/download/2.0/airPLS2.0.exe)
